With the support of the New Mexico Behavioral Health Collaborative, Volver Health applied for an [SBIR Grant](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/pa-21-260.html) with the [National Institute on Drug Abuse](https://nida.nih.gov/) at the [National Institutes of Health](https://nih.gov/) for our "Rumbo" software project.

As we know, substance use is a significant problem among Latinx and Hispanics due to the disproportionate number of physical harms and negative consequences associated with substance use relative to other racial/ethnic groups. However, Hispanics are less likely than other racial/ethnic groups to seek treatment for substance use, regardless of the substance(s) they use, and only 75% as likely to complete treatment for heroin as White individuals.

Treatment navigators, like patient portals, were originally intended to offset disparities in access to treatment and health care. Unfortunately, initial uptake of these patient-facing eHealth tools was found among white, educated, middle-class individuals already actively engaged in their own health care and not by socially disadvantaged and marginalized minority populations, as though the structural barriers to care that exist in the treatment system were carried forward in the solution meant to overcome them. Nonetheless, there are still many (including us) who believe that eHealth has the potential to help marginalized people seeking care to surmount these barriers.

Research over the last decade has revealed that adoption of eHealth among marginalized populations is influenced by factors such as health information-seeking behaviors, level of eHealth literacy, and technology acceptance, so we have designed a treatment navigator for Hispanics that is informed by these findings. Rumbo is an easily-shared, bilingual integrated web and mobile application that helps both Spanish-speaking and non-Spanish-speaking Hispanic individuals with substance use challenges find and access treatment services and related supportive resources. The proposed innovation stands out from other eHealth tools by leveraging the collective efficacy of the Hispanic community to overcome barriers and support individuals’ self-efficacy for engaging the treatment system. Our simple, user-centered design provides less-acculturated Hispanic individuals with a culturally appropriate tool to understand their needs within the complex US treatment system.

In this proposed NIH SBIR Phase I project, we will develop the app’s content and functions with a community-based, user-centered, iterative design process that will inform the content and functions of the app. We will gather key stakeholders in the Bernalillo County treatment system (the most populous area in New Mexico and 50% Hispanic) to develop a database of available, culturally appropriate resources, and to support both project recruitment and dissemination of the initial version of the app. Once completed, we will evaluate Rumbo’s acceptability and capability as a treatment navigator in a naturalistic implementation study, as well as how it is shared among users, and whether the individuals who use Rumbo subsequently have increased confidence in accessing services.

We've managed to gain the support of several important and relevant organizations to complete the project. These include:

- [New Mexico Behavioral Health Collaborative](https://www.hsd.state.nm.us/about_the_department/behavioral-health-collaborative/)
- [University of New Mexico Center for Social Policy](https://csp.unm.edu/)
- [University of New Mexico Division of Community Behavioral Health](https://hsc.unm.edu/medicine/departments/psychiatry/cbh/)
- [Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation](https://pire.org)
- [Boston University Center for Innovation in Social Work and Health](https://ciswh.org/)
- [Bernalillo County Health Equity Council](https://www.healthequitycouncil.net/)
- Bernalillo County Behavioral Health Initiative
- [Centro Sávila](https://www.centrosavila.org/)

If Rumbo is funded, we will begin work on this project in October 2022. Our team is excited to start this important work.
