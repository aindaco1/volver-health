## Funded Research

**2018 PI on NIDA funded Phase I SBIR grant** -- *An integrated mobile and web-based application for problem
cannabis use.* In this phase I project we adapted the Marijuana CheckUp for delivery via mobile app. I liaised
meetings with our expert consultants, developed the app’s intervention content, designed the program
architecture along with our software engineers, led the migration of C&C site’s content to a mobile platform
and subsequent integration C&C across platforms. Finally, conducted a feasibility study.
<br><br>
**2017-2018 PI on NIAAA funded Phase I SBIR grant** -- *A wearable tech app for CheckUp & Choices.* In this phase
I project we developed a drink tracker for use via smartwatch that was integrated with the CheckUp & Choices
platform. I developed the content, designed the program architecture along with our software engineers,
conducted a feasibility study and presented the findings.
<br><br>
**2016-2018 Co-I on NIAAA funded Phase II SBIR CRP grant** -- *An internet application for SMART Recovery.* In
this phase II CRP study, we developed a customized version of CheckUp & Choices in collaboration with
SMART Recovery International. After developing the SMART-version of C&C we recruited and collaborated
with 10 SMART programs across the country to develop programming that integrates the site with their
delivery of SMART.
<br><br>
**2013-2016 RA and Co-I on NIAAA funded the Phase I & II grants** -- *A web application to reduce heavy drinking
in first-time DWI offenders.* In this phase II CRP study, we developed an abstinence-focused program that
combined the Drinker’s CheckUp with our SMART-based Abstinence program. We conducted an initial
feasibility study and then in Phase II a randomized clinical trial in collaboration with Bernalillo County Metro
Court. Unfortunately, recruitment was difficult with this population, and our results failed to reach significance.
<br><br>
**2009-2013 RA on NIAAA funded Phase I & II SBIR grants** -- *An internet application for SMART Recovery.* In
phase I we developed a web-based abstinence-oriented program based on SMART Recovery for individuals
who wanted to reduce their alcohol, marijuana, stimulant or opiate use. In phase II we recruited nationally and
conducted a randomized clinical trial in collaboration with SMART Recovery and found that the program was
associated with significant reductions in overall drinking as well as drinking-related problems out to 12-months
post-baseline, and that it was most effective when incorporated with in-person or online SMART meetings.
<br><br>
**2008-2011 RA on NIAAA funded Phase I & II SBIR grants** -- *The College Drinker’s Check-Up.* In phase I we
developed a version of the Drinker’s CheckUp for college-aged adults, and in phase II we conducted a
randomized clinical trial in collaboration with University of New Mexico. For this study also conducted a
briefer trial to explore the effects of assessment reactivity. Results indicated that the CDCU was associated with significant reductions in binge drinking as well as drinking-related problems out to 12-months post-baseline.
<br><br>
**2007-2009 RA on NIAAA funded Phase II SBIR grant** -- *A Moderate Drinking web app.* for problem drinkers. In
this phase II clinical trial, we recruited in the Albuquerque metro area and conducted a randomized clinical trial. We found that the program was associated with significant increases in percentage of days per month
individuals were abstinent as well as significant reductions in drinking-related problems out to 6-months postbaseline.
