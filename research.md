## Funded Research

**2018 PI on NIDA-funded Phase I SBIR grant** -- *An integrated mobile and web-based application for problem cannabis use.* In this Phase I project, Dr. Campbell, in his capacity as Director of Clinical Development at CheckUp & Choices, adapted the Marijuana CheckUp for delivery via mobile app. He liaised meetings with our expert consultants, developed the app’s intervention content, designed the program architecture along with software engineers, led the migration of website content to a mobile platform, and conducted a feasibility study.

**2017-2018 PI on NIAAA-funded Phase I SBIR grant** -- *A wearable tech app for CheckUp & Choices.* In this Phase I project, Dr. Campbell, in his capacity as Director of Clinical Development at CheckUp & Choices, developed a drink tracker for use via smartwatch that was integrated with the CheckUp & Choices platform. He developed the content, designed the program architecture along with software engineers, conducted a feasibility study and presented the findings.
<br><br>
**2016-2018 Co-I on NIAAA-funded Phase II SBIR CRP grant** -- *An internet application for SMART Recovery.* In this Phase II CRP study, Dr. Campbell, in his capacity as Director of Clinical Development at CheckUp & Choices, co-developed a customized version of CheckUp & Choices in collaboration with SMART Recovery International.
<br><br>
**2013-2016 RA and Co-I on NIAAA-funded the Phase I & II grants** -- *A web application to reduce heavy drinking in first-time DWI offenders.* In this Phase II CRP study, Dr. Campbell, in his capacity as Director of Clinical Development at CheckUp & Choices, co-developed an abstinence-focused program that combined the Drinker’s CheckUp with the SMART-based Abstinence program. The team conducted an initial feasibility study for Phase I and a randomized clinical trial for Phase II in collaboration with Bernalillo County Metro Court. Unfortunately, recruitment was difficult with this population, and the results failed to reach significance.
<br><br>
**2009-2013 RA on NIAAA-funded Phase I & II SBIR grants** -- *An internet application for SMART Recovery.* In Phase I, Dr. Campbell co-developed a web-based abstinence-oriented program based on SMART Recovery for individuals who wanted to reduce their alcohol, marijuana, stimulant or opiate use. In Phase II, the team recruited nationally and conducted a randomized clinical trial in collaboration with SMART Recovery and found that the program was associated with significant reductions in overall drinking as well as drinking-related problems out to 12-months post-baseline, and that it was most effective when incorporated with in-person or online SMART meetings.
<br><br>
**2008-2011 RA on NIAAA-funded Phase I & II SBIR grants** -- *The College Drinker’s Check-Up.* In Phase I, Dr. Campbell co-developed a version of the Drinker’s CheckUp for college-aged adults, and in Phase II, the team conducted a randomized clinical trial in collaboration with University of New Mexico. For this study, he also conducted a shorter trial to explore the effects of assessment reactivity. Results indicated that the CDCU was associated with significant reductions in binge drinking as well as drinking-related problems out to 12-months post-baseline.
<br><br>
**2007-2009 RA on NIAAA-funded Phase II SBIR grant** -- *A Moderate Drinking web app for problem drinkers.* In this Phase II clinical trial, Dr. Campbell recruited in the Albuquerque metro area and conducted a randomized clinical trial. The team found that the program was associated with significant increases in percentage of days per month individuals were abstinent as well as significant reductions in drinking-related problems out to 6-months post-baseline.
